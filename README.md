# VocabVault

## Description
VocabVault is a web application designed to help language learners build and consolidate their vocabulary. Inspired by my experience learning Dutch, where I frequently encountered unfamiliar words but lacked a dedicated place to store and practice them, VocabVault provides an intuitive solution. Users can add new words alongside their translations, and the app periodically quizzes them to reinforce their knowledge and retention. While I use it for Dutch, VocabVault is versatile and adaptable for any language, making it a powerful tool for learners everywhere.
